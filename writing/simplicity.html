            <h1>Simplicity</h1>
            <p>If you went through the trouble of looking at the source code of this website on github...you will notice that it's written entirely in html and css. The primary reason for this is that I love building things from scratch,with the most minimal stack possible. I could have used bootstrap or any of the thousands of frameworks but it just wouldn't feel as good or authentic as writing my own styles. </p>
            <p>This also proved to be a great learning experience for me. For example, the header that you see is actually copy pasted across every file in the site. Now if this website was more complex then I can see why people would prefer to use something like react components or php.</p>
            <p>The website is good enough for the functionality that I am going to use it for, I don't need fancy frameworks or runtime environments just to share my thoughts in a bunch of articles I write.By keeping things simple, the page will load fast even on a slow internet connection and I don't have to worry about any vulnerabilities in my code that could affect the server.</p>
            <p>I've always wanted to make a personal website but never got around to doing it, but then I saw <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/hash-table-in-c/">this article</a> while searching for implementing hash tables in C. The article was beautifully written and best of all it was simple. As you can probably tell a lot of the design of this website was inspired from Ben Hoyt's site.</p>
            <p>I wanted to make a simple website and here it is! I hope you like it. </p>
